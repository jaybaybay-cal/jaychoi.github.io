            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I am originally from Herndon, Virginia, where my family moved in 2005, and lived there until I enrolled at boarding schools in Boston and New York. In between, I made a pivotal decision to redo my junior year for both academics and athletic pursuits, which turned out to be one of the best decisions I made in my adolescence, giving myself the chance to realign with my potential.</p>
            <p>Fast forward a bit, and you'd find me embracing the West Coast vibes, diving into the academic rigor at the University of California, Berkeley. I was hungry for knowledge and challenge, leading me to receive double degrees in Business Administration at the Walter A. Haas School of Business and Operations Research and Management Science within the IEOR department. As far as I know, I was the first to declare these two demanding fields simultaneously. After declaring my pursuit of the two degrees, I took a hiatus to serve in the Korean military, a commitment to honor my citizenship. This meant temporarily stepping away from my studies and watching some peers graduate ahead of me. Despite the pause, the experience was invaluable, exposing me to incredible scenes and allowing me to feel the historical weight of my surroundings in a way I never had before. My time with the U.S. Army was more than service; it was a personal chapter in my family's long narrative of cultural and political engagement. My great grandfather laid the foundation with his dedication to Korean independence and his pioneering academic journey at Duke University. My grandfather, seeking refuge amidst political uncertainty in Korea and escaping to the U.S., balanced night shifts at restaurants and liquor stores with daytime studies at UCLA, eventually returning and representing his nation as a diplomat across the United States, the Middle East, and Asia. My father, too, has made his mark, fostering international discourse through his role in the media industry. This legacy of resilience, education, and diplomacy is a torch I carry with pride, aiming to contribute to the ongoing dialogue between nations and cultures, just as my ancestors did. Since finishing my military and returning to school, I have embarked on numerous projects that have enriched my understanding of diverse fields and perspectives. From the soccer fields of youth to the serene golf courses of recent years, the transition from an avid soccer enthusiast to a relaxed golfer mirrors a journey of personal growth and evolving interests.</p>
            <p>These experiences weren't just time fillers; they were rich, reflective periods that shaped who I am. I've come to realize that my strength doesn't lie in a single niche. Instead, I thrive on adapting and applying a wide array of knowledge to drive impactful results. I like to think I see a bit further, a bit deeper than most, connecting dots and diving into matters with a blend of motivation and intellectual curiosity.</p>
            <p>So, as I continue on this ever-evolving journey, I invite you to join me. Let's share insights, experiences, and the lessons we gather along the way. Here's to embracing the vast tapestry of life, learning from every twist and turn, and making our unique mark on the world!</p>
