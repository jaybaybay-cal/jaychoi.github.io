            <h2>Side Projects</h2>
            <img src="side-projects-logo.png" alt="Side Projects Logo" class="small-img">
            <p>If you have the skills and willingness to collaborate on any of my side projects, I'd love to hear from you. Let's join forces and create something amazing together!</p>
            <p>Sports Platform in Asia: I want to build a vibrant, community-driven platform that changes the way people play sports, offering a seamless, all-in-one solution to find athletes, book fields, and potentially participate in leagues organized by the individuals’ network. It will eradicate the tedious need to pay for the field only to continuously struggle to find enough participants. It will also enable “democratization” of exercising because individuals will easily be able to register for a quick session without the need of multiple players.</p>
            <p>Concise Media Platform in South Korea: I want to build a clean and modern news and information platform designed to deliver vital, trustworthy content in a concise, efficient format that respects the user’s time and intelligence. It will cut through the noise to bring clear, actionable news and insights across various domains, including (geo)politics, business, technology, and culture. Its commitment to accuracy ensures that users stay informed with the least time spent, making it the go-to source for busy individuals who demand the highest quality information.</p>
            <p>YouTube Shorts: I aim to create a shorts channel dedicated to uncovering and disseminating the often ironic realities of our world's workings. The goal is to enlighten and empower viewers, stirring a critical awareness of the deceptive narratives and manipulations in various stories and systems. This channel will serve as a tool for people to see beyond the surface, fostering a deeper understanding and encouraging a questioning mindset.</p>
            <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Student Mentorship: Throughout my burgeoning professional career, I've had the honor of mentoring students, including speaking at university boot camps in Berkeley and Hong Kong. Each interaction not only allows me to impart knowledge but also provides me with deeper self-insight. I firmly believe in the power of helping others when we have the means to do so, recognizing that what may be challenging for one person could be straightforward for another. This philosophy drives my commitment to mentorship and community support.</p>
            <p><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Korea Network Forum: While serving as an ASUC Senator at Cal, I noticed a concerning gap in professional opportunities for the Korean student community. This issue stemmed from a combination of inadequate promotion by the school and a general lack of engagement from the students themselves. To address this, I organized a networking event that successfully connected Cal's talented students with major South Korean conglomerates, including Samsung, Hyundai, SK, LG, and others. This initiative aimed to bridge the gap and open new doors for our bright students. This career fair has continued every semester ever since.</p>
